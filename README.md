# CropCorp

Crop Corp is a project I've been working on in which I am trying to learn basic functions in the HTML5 between html, javascript, and css. The origins of Crop Corp come from the course Intro to Game Development in HTML5 by Pablo Farrias Navarro. Originally, the game was very bare bones and did not have many features, but I decided to grow it into something awesome, while developing my programming skills. 

Features I have added since acquiring the source files:


Learned to work with and use a Framework

Added title page scene and button

Added intro page scene and button

Written Intro and game rules

Conceptualized and Implemented new cast of plants, each with specific tropes in mind

Added growth and death states for plant development

Redesigned game scene to fit the growing demands and features of the game

Added plant preview during game scene

Reskined entire game with imported assets 

Coordinated with professional artists to describe, define, and develop ongoing visual and structural needs

Added Achievement scene 

Developed a variety of achievements to accomodate for all styles of play 

Restructured code with Object-Oriented Programming
 

Current Problems being worked on:

Unable to export code because of complications with the Framework (lime js)


Plans for the future:

Give plants individual attributes, i.e. singularity, multi-plot

Power-up shop

More Plant Variety, randomized shop

Win condition (and losing condition)

Building + compiling with the framework

Sound, music, and volume controls

Options menu, i.e. display FPS, adjust starting $$, banana mode

Pausing
