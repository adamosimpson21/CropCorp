# CropCorp

Crop Corp is a project I've been working on develop my skills as an HTML5 programmer. The origins of Crop Corp come from the course Intro to Game Development in HTML5 by Pablo Farrias Navarro. The game had a lot of potential, so I decided to grow it into something awesome while developing my programming skills. 

Features I have added since acquiring the source files:


Added title page scene and button

Added introductory page scene and button

Written introductory and game rules

Conceptualized and Implemented new cast of plants, each with specific tropes in mind

Added growth and death states for plant development

Redesigned game scene to fit the growing demands and features of the game

Added plant preview during game scene

Reskined entire game with imported assets 

Coordinated with professional artists to describe, define, and develop ongoing visual and structural needs

Added Achievement scene 

Developed a variety of achievements to accomodate for all styles of play 

Restructured code with Object-Oriented Programming


Things I've Learned:

Working with a Framework

Working with multiple files, including html, js, css, and jpeg

Object-Oriented Programming

Directors, scenes, and layers

Code Structure

If/else loop structure, syntax, and use


Current Problems being worked on:

Unable to export code because of complications with the Framework (lime js)


Plans for the future:

Give plants individual attributes, i.e. singularity, multi-plot

Power-up shop

More Plant Variety, randomized shop

Win condition (and losing condition)

Building + compiling with the framework

Sound, music, and volume controls

Options menu, i.e. display FPS, adjust starting $$, banana mode

Pausing
